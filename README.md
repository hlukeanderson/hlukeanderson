### Howdy 👋

- 🐦 I’m currently working on a project investigating the genomic impacts of strong sexual selection in a family of Neotropical lek-mating birds, the manakins (Aves: Pipridae).
- 🐍 I conduct community-engaged research in the Chocó region of northwest Ecuador.
- 🌱 I’m new to GitHub and looking to improve my programming skills.
- 🎸 Fun fact: I play bass and guitar. Always down to jam!
