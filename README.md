### About Me

I am a behavioral ecologist and evolutionary biologist at Tulane University. My dissertation research seeks to untangle the relative contributions of genes, the environment, and their interactions in shaping male mating success in the white-bearded manakin, a lek-mating tropical bird with high male reproductive skew. I am interested in how sexual selection processes may be influenced by ecological variability in time and space. In addition, I use genomic approaches to determine whether ratios of sex-chromosome:autosome nucleotide diversity can serve as a measure of sexual selection strength. I have experience in statistical modeling, field biology, molecular lab work, bioinformatics, behavioral observation, and ornithology.
